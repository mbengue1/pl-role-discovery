### Gaps
- I expected to find more datasets with explicit per-90 normalization and 600-minute filters, but these specifics were not always clearly stated.
- Some datasets did not specify the exact number of players covered, requiring estimation based on typical squad sizes.

### Notes
- There is some inconsistency in the exact number of players covered across datasets, likely due to differences in data collection methods or updates.
- Licensing terms were generally clear, but the application of these licenses to derivative works (like clustering) could require further legal review.
