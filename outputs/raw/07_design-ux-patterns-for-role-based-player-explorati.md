**Interaction Design:**
- **Scatter Plots:** Interactive scatter plots allow users to visualize player performance metrics across different dimensions.
- **Role Heatmaps:** Heatmaps show player activity zones on the pitch, with interactive toggles to switch between different metrics.
- **Explainability Tools:** Tooltips and overlays explain the significance of various metrics and their impact on role assignment.

#### Example 3: Tableau Public Soccer Dashboard

### Gaps
- Specific examples of SHAP or permutation importance visualizations in soccer analytics were not found.
- Detailed user feedback or case studies on the effectiveness of these interfaces in real-world scenarios were limited.

### Notes
- There is a consistent emphasis on interactive and customizable visualizations across platforms, which aligns well with the project’s goals.
- The integration of explainability tools is less common, suggesting an opportunity for differentiation in the final app design.
