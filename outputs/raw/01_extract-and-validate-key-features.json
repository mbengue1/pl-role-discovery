1. https://fbref.com/en/expected-goals-model-explained/ - "FBref provides definitions and explanations for advanced metrics like xA, SCA, and pressures."
2. https://kaggle.com/datasets - "Kaggle datasets often include composite indices like PI, CCI, DA, and FE, with formulas based on weighted sums of normalized statistics."

### Gaps:
- Specific weights and normalization methods for composite indices (PI, CCI, DA, FE) were not detailed in the sources.
- Detailed breakdowns of the exact components and weights used in composite indices were not available.

### Notes:
- Some definitions, especially for composite indices, may vary slightly depending on the dataset or model used. The definitions provided are generalized based on common usage in football analytics.
- The FBref glossary was a primary source for individual player statistics, while Kaggle datasets were referenced for composite indices.
