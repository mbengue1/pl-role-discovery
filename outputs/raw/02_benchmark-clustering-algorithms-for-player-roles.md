# Benchmarking Clustering Algorithms for Player Roles

## Introduction

In the context of discovering player roles in the Premier League using advanced statistics, clustering algorithms like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are pivotal. This summary provides a comparison of these algorithms based on their application in sports analytics, particularly in soccer for role discovery.

## Pros and Cons Table

| Algorithm       | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **K-Means**     | - Simple and fast to compute<br>- Works well with large datasets<br>- Easy to interpret and implement | - Assumes spherical clusters<br>- Sensitive to initial seed<br>- Requires pre-specification of cluster number |
| **GMM**         | - Can model non-spherical clusters<br>- Provides probabilistic cluster membership<br>- More flexible with covariance structures | - Computationally intensive<br>- Prone to overfitting<br>- Requires careful initialization and selection of components |

## Recommended Best Practices

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure data is normalized (e.g., per-90 statistics) to maintain consistency across features.
2. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Use **K-Means** for initial exploration due to its simplicity and speed, especially with large datasets.
   - Consider **GMM** when the data suggests overlapping clusters or when a probabilistic interpretation is beneficial.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like Silhouette Score and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate clustering quality.
   - Cross-validate with domain knowledge and visualizations (e.g., scatter plots) to ensure meaningful clusters.
4. **Explainability**:
   - Employ SHAP or permutation importance to understand feature contributions to cluster assignments.
5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Start with K-Means to identify potential cluster centers, then refine with GMM for more nuanced clustering.

## Gaps

- Detailed case studies specifically applying these algorithms to Premier League data were limited.
- Comparative performance metrics specific to soccer role discovery were not extensively covered.

## Notes

- Some sources highlighted the challenge of selecting the number of clusters, which is crucial for both K-Means and GMM.
- There was a consensus on the importance of domain knowledge in validating clustering results, which is critical in sports analytics.
