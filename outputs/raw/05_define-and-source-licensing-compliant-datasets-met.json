The final output will be a Streamlit web app that allows users to:\n1. Search for any Premier League player\n2. View their clustered role and similar players\n3. Explore role-specific statistics via radar charts and heatmaps\n4. Visualize the player landscape in 2D PCA/UMAP scatter plots\n5. Understand which features drive role assignment using explainability tools (SHAP/Permutation Importance)\n\nKey technical components include:\n- Feature engineering: Per-90 normalization + composite indices (PI, CCI, DA, FE)\n- Clustering: PCA + K-Means/GMM to group players into roles\n- Explainability: SHAP/permutation importance with RandomForest surrogates\n- Visualization: Interactive radar charts, scatter plots, role heatmaps\n\nYou are assigned to research the following task:\n\nDefine and Source Licensing-Compliant Datasets\n\n**Scope:**\nVerify publicly available Premier League datasets (FBref, Kaggle, etc.) that meet licensing, attribution, and format needs for per-90 normalized stats with at least 600-minute filters.\n\n**Deliverable Format:**\nJSON list of datasets with: dataset_name, source_url, license_type, season_covered, player_count\n\n**Tools Available:**\nFBref exports, Kaggle, GitHub datasets\n\n**Heuristics:**\n1. Start with a broad query, then narrow based on findings.\n2. Prioritize primary sources and official documentation.\n3. Avoid duplicate queries or sources.\n4. If sources disagree, summarize all viewpoints.\n5. Stop when the stop condition is met: 3 valid datasets covering EPL 2022/23 outfield players with at least 90% coverage\n\nYour research must be specific to the Premier League Player Role Discovery project context provided above.\nFocus on soccer/football analytics, player statistics, and the specific technical approaches mentioned.\n\nReturn your result in the specified format, and also include:\n- `citations`: List of URLs and short 15â€“40 word source quotes.\n- `gaps`: Any info you expected to find but could not.\n- `notes`: Optional insights about conflicting definitions or unclear points.\n"
