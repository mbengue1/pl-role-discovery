# Premier League Player Role Discovery - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The **Premier League Player Role Discovery** project applies unsupervised machine learning to discover data-driven player roles in the English Premier League. Instead of relying on traditional position labels (DEF, MID, FWD), the model clusters players into functional roles based on their statistical performance.

## Key Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Processed 563 Premier League players with 266 features
   - Implemented per-90 normalization and feature engineering
   - Created composite indices for key player attributes

2. **Advanced Machine Learning Implementation**
   - Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction (90% variance with 3 components)
   - Implemented K-Means clustering with rigorous evaluation metrics
   - Achieved excellent stability (ARI: 0.9143) and separation (Silhouette: 0.2455)

3. **Explainability Framework**
   - Developed RandomForest surrogate model for role prediction
   - Implemented SHAP values for local and global explanations
   - Added permutation importance for feature validation

4. **Interactive Streamlit Application**
   - Created a modern, responsive web interface
   - Implemented comprehensive logging and error handling
   - Designed intuitive visualizations for player and cluster exploration

5. **Production-Ready Implementation**
   - Modular, well-documented code structure
   - Comprehensive test suite and validation
   - Deployment-ready for Streamlit Cloud

## Discovered Player Roles

The analysis identified three distinct player roles:

1. **The Enforcers (29.5% of players)**
   - Defensive specialists with high tackles, interceptions, and blocks
   - Strong in aerial duels and defensive actions
   - Example players: [List top representatives]

2. **The Balanced Players (52.2% of players)**
   - Versatile players with balanced attacking and defensive contributions
   - Well-rounded statistical profiles across multiple categories
   - Example players: [List top representatives]

3. **The Attackers (18.3% of players)**
   - Goal threats with high shots on target and clinical finishing
   - Strong creative and attacking metrics
   - Example players: [List top representatives]
